Let the wind carry us
To the clouds, hurry up, alright
We can travel so far
As our eyes can see
We go where no one goes
We slow for no one
Get out of our way
Awake in the sky
We break up so high, alright
Let's make it our own,
Let's savor it
We go where no one goes
We slow for no one
Get out of our way
We slow for no one
We go where no one goes
We slow for no one
We go where no one goes
We go where no one goes
